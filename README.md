=====

Edward Snowden is the whistleblower who unveiled ultra-secret NSA World Global Surveillance programs. He has been charged by the US government with theft of governement property, unauthorised communication of national defense information, and deliberate communication of classified Communication Intelligence information. Edward Snowden risks life imprisonment and even death penalty for his « crimes. » These revelations have forced him to go into exile in the airside transit area of Sheremetyevo airport., where he stayed for almost six weeks. He is now in Moscow, where they granted him temporary asylum.

We want the Canadian government to accept Snowden in Canada and to give him political asylum. 

Canada’s welcoming you, Edward Snowden
